                <p>Hello and welcome to the Game Development Association website. We are a club at Colorado State University that is dedicated to bringing students with different majors from the university together in order to create a video game bigger than anyone could do on their own by learning to work in a cross-disciplinary team. </p>
                <p><a href="index.html"><img src = "images/gda_logo_white.png" alt = "Game Development Association" class = "float-right"></a>If a person is interested in joining the club, there is no requirements necessary for joining it except having a passion for games. Because we work in a cross disciplinary environment if a person comes in with not a lot of experience then other members of the group will help you learn new skills.</p>
                <p>In terms of what we do, we tend to have one massive project going on during either one semester or one school year which consists of all the members working on a new game. We also do smaller events from time to time such as meeting with other game developers in the industry and participate in game jams. Game jams are competitions that involve a small team making a video game in less than 24-48 hours depending on the game jam.  </p>
                    
                <p>If you are not yet intrigued to join the Game Development Association, here is a video created by Dylan Plomondon Interviewing members of the Game Development Association about why they decided to join the Game Development Association and what they like about game design. It was originally created for Dylan's blog Development Ready but it's still a decent video with old members of the game development association.
